# Social Network App

## Description:
In this week's coding bootcamp challenge, we built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. We used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

Because this application wasn’t deployed, a walkthrough video was created to demonstrate its functionality.
